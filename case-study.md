# Nomad Rentals - Full-Stack Development Case Study

## 📋 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
The long-term rental market lacks a dedicated platform optimized for remote workers, digital nomads, and professionals seeking accommodations for 1+ months. Existing platforms like Airbnb are primarily designed for short-term stays, leading to:

- **Pricing Inefficiencies**: Daily rates don't scale well for monthly stays
- **Limited Search Filters**: Lack of work-friendly amenities (reliable WiFi, desk space, etc.)
- **Communication Gaps**: No dedicated features for long-term tenant-landlord relationships
- **Booking Complexity**: Cumbersome process for extended stays

### Solution Approach
Develop a specialized rental marketplace that addresses these pain points with:

- **Long-term Focus**: Optimized for monthly+ rentals with appropriate pricing models
- **Remote Work Features**: Filters for WiFi speed, workspace availability, and professional amenities
- **Enhanced Communication**: Built-in messaging and tenant screening tools
- **Streamlined Booking**: Simplified process for extended stays with flexible terms

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Digital nomads and remote workers (25-40 years old)
- **Secondary**: Corporate housing managers and relocation specialists
- **Tertiary**: Traditional long-term tenants seeking furnished accommodations

## 📊 Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Technology Choices

| Technology | Alternative Considered | Decision Rationale |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **TanStack Router** | React Router | Superior TypeScript support, built-in data loading, type-safe parameters |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styled Components | Faster development, consistent design system, smaller bundle size |
| **shadcn/ui** | Material-UI | Better customization, modern design, excellent TypeScript support |
| **React Hook Form** | Formik | Better performance, smaller bundle, excellent TypeScript integration |
| **Zod** | Yup | Type inference, better TypeScript integration, runtime safety |
| **PostgreSQL** | MongoDB | ACID compliance, complex relationships, mature ecosystem |
| **Vite** | Create React App | Faster builds, modern tooling, better development experience |

### Architecture Patterns

**Frontend Patterns**:
- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from simple, reusable components
- **Custom Hooks**: Extracting stateful logic for reusability and testing
- **Service Layer**: Separating API logic from components
- **Type-First Development**: Defining TypeScript types before implementation

**Backend Patterns** (Planned):
- **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access logic
- **Middleware Chain**: Composable request processing
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management and logging
